# Maxima-Finding-for-Accelerometer-Data-without-Sampling
In this repo I have added a function which selects the 'n' number of peaks from the accelerometer data. Basically the motivation for creating this function was to perform robust, efficient data compression for the acceleometer data. It is basically used in a sensor which records the acceleration of the 'Injection molding machine'.
# Injection Molding Maachine
An injection molding machine is a highly versatile manufacturing tool used to produce parts by injecting molten material into a mold. It is widely used in industries ranging from automotive to consumer goods, electronics, medical devices, and packaging. The machine primarily processes thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers, but can also handle other materials like metals and glass.
